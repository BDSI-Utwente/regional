Description:

    accounting for already allocated seats in multi-phase seat allocation (e.g.,
    when allocation national seats to compensate for disproportionality in seats
    awarded in districts). 
    This package is heavily inspired by the `electoral` package, but rewritten 
    from the ground up.
