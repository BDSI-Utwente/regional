#' Allocate seats across parties using different methods of allocation
#'
#' Given a set of parties and associated vote counts, allocate `seats` number of
#' seats using one of several common methods of seat allocation.
#'
#' @param parties vector of party names (or other identifiers)
#' @param votes vector of vote counts per party
#' @param seats total number of seats available, **including** any seats already
#'  allocated using the `fixed_seats` argument.
#' @param fixed_seats vector of seat counts already allocated to each party that
#'  should be considered 'fixed'. Defaults to a zero vector, i.e., no seats have
#'  yet been allocated.
#' @param method one of several methods of seat allocation. See details. Defaults
#'  to 'dh' for d'Hondt method.
#' @param threshold vote share required to be eligible for any seats. Defaults to
#'  0, should be in the range \[0,1\]. Common values are between 0 and 0.05.
#' @param fixed_seat_overrides_threshold should parties with fixed seats automatically
#'  be eligible for remainder seat allocation? This is common in some parliamentary
#'  systems. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#'
#' @return A tibble containing several columns:
#' \item{party}{party name}
#' \item{votes}{number of votes}
#' \item{seats}{total number of assigned seats}
#' \item{fixed_seats}{number of previously allocated seats considered 'fixed'}
#' \item{allocated_seats}{number of seats allocated in this allocation step,
#'  equal to `seats - fixed_seats`}
#' \item{ideal_seats}{'ideal' number of seats under perfectly proportional
#'  representation. Calculated as `votes / sum(votes) * seats`}

#' # is automatically compensated.
#'
#' # In some electoral systems, parties that gain a regional seat
#' # are exempt from a national threshold. If we give all parties a single
#' # fixed seat, we can see that Party e will be allocated 2 additional
#' # seats, even though the party does not meet the vote share threshold.
